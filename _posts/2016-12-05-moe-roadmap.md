While the MOE project blog was not updated in the last couple of weeks, the team was working hard to get the next releases of MOE out the door.

## The Road So Far

Since the start of the Multi-OS Engine Open Source Project we made a number of releases:

   * Released by Intel
   * Open-sourced both the stable branch and also the development branch (Android 7 based)

* **H1/2017 MOE 2.0 final**

## What is planned for MOE 1.3

MOE 1.3 is a huge update, it includes:

 * Redesigned Xcode Project Layout
 * Support for native dependency management frameworks (e.g. [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) or [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage))
 * Redesigned native library binding handling
 * Standard MOE Bindings
 * Redesigned Storyboard integration
 * and more!

In fact, we prepared another blog post to provide details about the new features of MOE 1.3 and beyond. [Read on here for all the cool, new stuff!](/blog/2016-12-05-plans-for-moe-1.3/).

## What is planned for MOE 2.0

MOE 2.0 will have 2 main features:

 * Update to Android 7
  * Jack will be used as the main toolchain, including ProGuard support
 * The introduction of the LLVM based compiler backend for Bitcode support

Despite the big internal changes, MOE 2.x will be mostly a drop-in replacement from the app developer's point of view.

We will provide more details of the new features in future blog posts.
