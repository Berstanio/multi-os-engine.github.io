## About

The Multi-OS Engine is the only full featured solution to develop iOS Apps in Java. It was developed by Intel, based on ART, the Android runtime.  The Multi-OS Engine includes the technology acquired from Migeran's [Migeran for iOS](https://www.migeran.com/migeran-for-ios/) product. 

The Multi-OS Engine source code is freely available under the Apache 2 license. The Multi-OS Engine will be developed and maintained as an open source project with Migeran as the project lead.
